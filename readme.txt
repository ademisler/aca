ACA is an intelligent WordPress plugin that learns your existing content's tone and style to autonomously generate high-quality, SEO-friendly new posts.

== Description ==

Content creation requires time and effort. ACA - AI Content Agent is designed to automate this process and elevate your site's content strategy. This plugin doesn't just generate random content; it analyzes your existing posts to learn your site's unique voice, tone, and writing style. This ensures that every new draft it produces is cohesive and consistent with your brand.

Powered by Google's powerful Gemini API, ACA generates new and engaging blog post ideas for your site, converts these ideas into full-fledged drafts upon your approval, and even enriches these drafts with SEO elements like featured images, internal links, and sources.

With manual, semi-automatic, and fully automatic working modes, you are in complete control. Whether you just want it to generate ideas or prefer to sit back and watch new post drafts appear in your WordPress dashboard, ACA has you covered. ACA is poised to be your smartest assistant for accelerating your content marketing processes while maintaining quality.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What do I need to use this plugin? =
You need a Google Gemini API key for the plugin to function. You can get a free API key from the Google AI Studio.

= Is the plugin free? =
Yes, the core features of ACA (manual idea and draft generation, style analysis, GSC integration, etc.) are completely free. For advanced features like the Content Cluster Planner, DALL-E 3 image generation, plagiarism checks, and full automation, you will need to upgrade to ACA Pro.

= Is the generated content original and will it pass AI detectors? =
The plugin generates highly original content using Google Gemini. However, all generated content is considered a "draft". We strongly recommend that you review, edit, and fact-check all content before publishing. As it is AI-generated, it may be detected by AI detectors. The final responsibility for the published content is yours.

= How does the plugin learn my writing style? =
It analyzes your most recently published content from the post types you specify in the settings (e.g., blog posts). Based on this analysis, it creates a "Style Guide" that includes elements like tone, sentence structure, and paragraph length. New content is then written according to this guide.

= What is Action Scheduler? =
Action Scheduler is a library used to reliably run background tasks in WordPress. ACA uses it to handle scheduled tasks like automatic idea generation and draft writing, ensuring they run smoothly without impacting your site's performance.
